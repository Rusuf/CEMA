# Project Requirements

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Basic Health Information System (BHIS) Prototype.

## 1. System Users

*   **Doctor:** The primary user of the system, responsible for managing client and program information.

## 2. Functional Requirements

The system must allow the Doctor to:

1.  **Create Health Program:**
    *   Define a new health program with relevant details (e.g., name like TB, Malaria, HIV, description).
    *   Store and manage a list of available health programs.
2.  **Register New Client:**
    *   Add a new client record to the system.
    *   Capture essential client details (e.g., unique ID, name, date of birth, contact information).
3.  **Enroll Client in Program(s):**
    *   Select a registered client.
    *   Select one or more available health programs.
    *   Record the enrollment details (e.g., enrollment date).
4.  **Search for Client:**
    *   Search for clients based on identifying information (e.g., name, ID).
    *   Display a list of matching registered clients.
5.  **View Client Profile:**
    *   Select a client from the search results or list.
    *   Display the client's detailed profile information.
    *   Include a list of health programs the client is currently enrolled in.
6.  **Expose Client Profile via API:**
    *   Provide a secure API endpoint to retrieve a specific client's profile (including enrolled programs).
    *   This API is intended for consumption by other authorized systems.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Clean Code:** Source code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Documentation:** Code should include meaningful comments where necessary. Project documentation (like this file, architecture, API) should be clear and comprehensive.
*   **Ease of Understanding:** The overall system design and implementation should be straightforward to comprehend.
*   **Testability:** The system should be designed in a way that facilitates unit and integration testing (Application tests are a desired enhancement).
*   **Security:** Basic data security considerations should be included, especially for the API (Specific measures are TBD, potentially an enhancement).

## 4. Optional Requirements / Enhancements ("Would be Great" / "Amazing")

*   **Application Tests:** Implement unit tests and potentially integration tests.
*   **API-First Approach:** Design and document the API before implementation.
*   **Innovations & Optimizations:** Explore potential improvements to the basic functionality or performance.
*   **Data Security Considerations:** Implement more robust security measures (e.g., authentication/authorization for the API, data encryption).
*   **Deployment:** Package the solution for deployment (e.g., using Docker).
