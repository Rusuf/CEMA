## Features

This system allows healthcare workers to:

1. **Create health programs** (TB, Malaria, HIV, etc.) - Set up specialized care programs with custom attributes
2. **Register clients** into the system - Capture essential demographic and health information
3. **Enroll clients** in one or more health programs - Track participation across multiple health initiatives
4. **Search for clients** from the registered list - Find patients quickly with powerful search functionality
5. **View client profiles** including enrolled programs - Comprehensive patient information in one place
6. **Access client data via API** for external system integration - Secure data sharing with authorized systems

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, SQLite database (easily scalable to PostgreSQL)
- **API**: RESTful with JSON responses, key-based authentication
- **Frontend**: To be implemented (planned with React.js)
- **Security**: Input validation, data encryption for sensitive information

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.8+
   - pip

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database configuration:**
   The database configuration is in `backend/.env`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///bhis.db
   API_KEY=dev_api_key_for_testing
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python run.py
   ```

5. **Access the API:**
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - API base URL: http://localhost:8000/

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/test_bhis.py -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_bhis.py -k "api" -v    # API tests
python -m pytest tests/test_bhis.py -k "program" -v  # Program tests
python -m pytest tests/test_bhis.py -k "client" -v   # Client tests
```

## API Endpoints

- **Programs:**
  - `POST /programs/` - Create a health program
  - `GET /programs/` - List all programs

- **Clients:**
  - `POST /clients/` - Register a client
  - `GET /clients/?search=<name>` - List/search clients
  - `GET /clients/{client_id}` - View client profile

- **Enrollments:**
  - `POST /clients/{client_id}/enrollments/` - Enroll client in program

- **External API (requires API key):**
  - `GET /api/clients/{client_id}` - Get client profile via API

## Security Implementation

- API endpoints protected with key-based authentication
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and other attacks
- Designed with data privacy considerations for healthcare information
- Role-based access control for different user types
